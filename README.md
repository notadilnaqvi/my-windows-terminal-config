# My Window Terminal config

I switched over from [cmder](https://cmder.net/) to Windows Terminal in mid 2019. I've loved using it so far. Get to know more about Windows Terminal [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/terminal/)

## How to have the same configuration as me

* Open Windows Terminal and hit `crtl+,` to open `settings.json`
* Before you start editing, I suggest you save a backup of this file
* Now remove all text from your `settings.json` and replace it with the code in my `settings.json`
* Be sure to change the directory paths
* If you want, you can change the uids for all profiles. Get new guids by running `[guid]::NewGuid()` in PowerShell or visit [the guid generator](https://www.guidgenerator.com/)
* Hit save
* Congratulations! We now share a similar looking terminal :heart:
* Snoop around with the settings to configure it to your liking
